# Crop Yield Prediction Web App
it is an application that serves as a web-based user interface for a machine learning model, which predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental variables. It is built using the Django web framework and serves as a simple example of an API that provides machine learning-based predictions in real-time.
This application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Users can input the name of the district and the month for which they want to predict the suitable crop to grow. The application uses an AJAX request to submit the input data to the server and returns the predicted output without reloading the page.
The user only inputs the name of the district and month as input however, internally machine learning model uses 7 parameters like temperature,rainfall,humidity,ratio of nitrogen in soil etc.
The application is intended for use by farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers who are interested in predicting crop yield for a given district and month in India. The application can help farmers make informed decisions about planting crops and predicting their harvest, while researchers and policymakers can use it to analyze crop yield trends and make policy decisions based on the data.
